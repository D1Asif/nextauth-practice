This is my NextAuth practice project. Implemented the following:
1. OAuth: Google sign in, Github sign in
2. Sign in with credentials: email and password

Technologies used: Next JS, NextAuth, MongoDB, Tailwind CSS etc.

Clerk is a popular and paid alternative of NextAuth that comes with a generous free plan. If saving the development time in exchange of money is a priority, then Clerk can be an excellent choice.
